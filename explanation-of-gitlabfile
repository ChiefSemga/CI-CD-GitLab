# Complete Explanation:

# Build Stage:

Each platform has its own build job (build_powerpc, build_imx8, build_linux_x), which uses a reusable build template.
The build jobs are triggered based on branch or tag rules (e.g., imx8 builds only on main or tags).

# Static Code Analysis Stage:

The static code analysis jobs run after the build. The jobs clone an external template repository and run static analysis scripts using platform-specific configurations.

# Test Stage:

After the build, platform-specific test jobs execute tests defined in corresponding Makefiles. Each test job depends on its related build job to ensure the code is built before testing.

# Deploy Stage:

Each deploy job uploads the build artifacts to the target server using scp and then runs a smoke test on the target server to verify the deployment.
This .gitlab-ci.yml ensures efficient parallelization and separation of concerns for different platforms, along with automatic deployment and verification steps.
