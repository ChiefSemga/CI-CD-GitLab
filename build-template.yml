#  Build Stage

The build stage compiles the code for three different platforms:
PowerPC,
imx8, and 
Linux-x.
Each platform uses a different toolchain image.
We define a reusable template for the build process and customize it for each platform.

# Reusable Build Template:
This is a template that handles the general build process, allowing for platform-specific configurations via variables:

.build_template:
  script:
    - echo "Building on platform $PLATFORM"
    - make -f Makefile.$PLATFORM  # Each platform will have a corresponding Makefile
  only:
    - development
    - main
    - tags
  variables:
    PLATFORM: ""  # Default empty, to be set by each platform-specific job
