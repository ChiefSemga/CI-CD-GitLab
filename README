# GitLab CI/CD Pipeline for Multi-Platform Build, Test, and Deployment
This project demonstrates a complete GitLab CI/CD pipeline designed to build, test, and deploy software for three different platforms: PowerPC, imx8, and Linux-x. Each platform has its own specific toolchain, static analysis requirements, and deployment processes.

The pipeline is configured in the .gitlab-ci.yml file, with clear separation into the following stages:

Build
Static Code Analysis
Test
Deployment

This README provides an overview of the pipeline, its structure, and how to use it effectively.
