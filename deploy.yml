# Deploy Stage:
# The deployment stage uploads the built software to a target server and performs a smoke test to ensure the deployment was successful. 
# Each platform has a corresponding deploy job.

# Platform-Specific Deploy Jobs:

# PowerPC Deploy Job:

deploy_powerpc:
  script:
    - echo "Deploying PowerPC build to target"
    - scp build_output/powerpc.tar.gz target:/path/to/deploy  # SCP to target server
    - ssh target "test -f /path/to/deploy/powerpc.tar.gz && echo 'PowerPC deployment successful'"  # Smoke test
  stage: deploy
  dependencies:
    - test_powerpc  # Ensure tests have passed before deploying

# imx8 Deploy Job:

deploy_imx8:
  script:
    - echo "Deploying imx8 build to target"
    - scp build_output/imx8.tar.gz target:/path/to/deploy  # SCP to target server
    - ssh target "test -f /path/to/deploy/imx8.tar.gz && echo 'imx8 deployment successful'"  # Smoke test
  stage: deploy
  dependencies:
    - test_imx8  # Ensure tests have passed before deploying


# Linux-x Deploy Job:

deploy_linux_x:
  script:
    - echo "Deploying Linux-x build to target"
    - scp build_output/linux-x.tar.gz target:/path/to/deploy  # SCP to target server
    - ssh target "test -f /path/to/deploy/linux-x.tar.gz && echo 'Linux-x deployment successful'"  # Smoke test
  stage: deploy
  dependencies:
    - test_linux_x  # Ensure tests have passed before deploying
