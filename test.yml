# Test Stage:
# The test stage runs platform-specific tests after the build stage. 
# Each platform has its own test job, which depends on the successful completion of its respective build job.
# Platform-Specific Test Jobs:
# Each test job runs tests from the corresponding Makefile.

# PowerPC Test Job:

test_powerpc:
  script:
    - echo "Running tests on PowerPC build"
    - make test -f Makefile.powerpc  # Test using PowerPC-specific Makefile
  stage: test
  dependencies:
    - build_powerpc  # Ensure that build job has completed before running tests

# imx8 Test Job:

test_imx8:
  script:
    - echo "Running tests on imx8 build"
    - make test -f Makefile.imx8  # Test using imx8-specific Makefile
  stage: test
  dependencies:
    - build_imx8  # Ensure that build job has completed before running tests

# Linux-x Test Job:

test_linux_x:
  script:
    - echo "Running tests on Linux-x build"
    - make test -f Makefile.linux-x  # Test using Linux-x-specific Makefile
  stage: test
  dependencies:
    - build_linux_x  # Ensure that build job has completed before running tests
